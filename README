README for hardlink
=====================
hardlink is a tool which replaces multiple copies of a file with hardlinks.
Inspiration came from http://code.google.com/p/hardlinkpy/, but no code has
been used.

I started from scratch because the original code was just to hard to read, to
old, supported even Python 1.5, and did not conform to PEP 8. In contrast,
this code conforms to PEP 8 and passes pylint and pychecker without any kind
of information (e.g. warnings) being displayed.

Differences to hardlinkpy
-------------------------
 For users of hardlinkpy, several things are different. One of the most
 important changes is the renaming of all --foo-ignore arguments to
 --ignore-foo ones. This is more similar to the naming of options in GNU
 programs.

 --timestamp-ignore has been renamed to --ignore-time
 --owner-ignore has been renamed to --ignore-owner
 --rights-ignore has been renamed to --ignore-mode
 --filenames-equal has been renamed to --respect-filename

 The option --reverse has been renamed to --minimize. The option --max has
 been renamed to --maximize.

 At the moment, no verbose mode is supported and the output is different. This
 may change at a later point.
