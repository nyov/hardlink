.SH NAME
hardlink \- Link multiple copies of a file
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B hardlink
.RI [ option ]...
.RI [ directory ]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B hardlink
is a tool which replaces copies of a file with hardlinks, therefore saving
space.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-h or \-\-help
print quick usage details to the screen.
.TP
.B \-v or \-\-verbose
More verbose output. If specified once, every hardlinked file is displayed,
if specified twice, it also shows every comparison.
.TP
.B \-n or \-\-dry\-run
Do not act, just print what would happen
.TP
.B \-f or \-\-respect\-name
Only try to link files with the same (basename).
.TP
.B \-p or \-\-ignore\-mode
Link/compare files even if their mode is different. This may be a bit unpredictable.
.TP
.B \-o or \-\-ignore\-owner
Link/compare files even if their owner (user and group) is different. It is not
predictable
.TP
.B \-t or \-\-ignore\-time
Link/compare files even if their time of modification is different. This will
retain the newest timestamp, unless \-m or \-M is given.
.TP
.B \-m or \-\-maximize
Try to maximize the link count of the files.
.TP
.B \-M or \-\-minimize
Try to minimize the link count of the files.
.TP
.B \-x or \-\-exclude
A regular expression which excludes files from being compared and linked.
.TP
.B \-i or \-\-include
A regular expression to include files. If the option \-\-exclude has been given,
this option re-includes files which would otherwise be excluded. If the option
is used without \-\-exclude, only files matched by the pattern are included.
.TP
.B \-l or \-\-low-memory
Tell hardlink to not keep all the information in memory. This causes hardlink
to read much more often from the disk, but has the benefit of requiring only
a very small percentage of the memory required by the normal mode.

This mode is for situation where you have more than 500,000 files to compare
or not enough memory (~480MB) to compare 500,000 files using the standard mode.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.B hardlink
takes one or more directories which will be searched for files to be linked.
