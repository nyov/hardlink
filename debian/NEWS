hardlink (0.2.0~rc1) experimental; urgency=low

  Hardlink has been rewritten in C. As part of this rewrite, hardlink
  has switched to process regular expressions using a PCRE library,
  libpcreposix. The format understood by PCRE may differ in details
  from the format understood by Python's regular expression engine.

  Hardlink should require far less memory now.
